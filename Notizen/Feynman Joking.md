Notes on Book: Surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman

Already as a young child, Feynman realized many of the things it took me 25 or 30 years to realize about life. Especially as a kid, but to a degree maybe until I was close to 30, I believed that when people spoke, they did so to convey a truth about the world. Even when they said obviously false things, it was to me because they were simply mistaken about something.

Feynman has a very interesting way of dealing with bureaucracy as well. He is always keen on turning his interactions with others into a game - at least in the stories he shares in the book. I find that this is a very effective way of dealing with the world. When I was younger however, I was convinced that the systems put in place by others and those before me were put in place with the best intentions in mind. People had existed for so long, I believed, they must have figured out how to best regulate a society and I was thus sceptical of behaviour that undermined these systems. Feynman realized that this was not the case.

One can of course question a great deal of his behaviour and throughout the book, I could not help but wonder how much of it was simply accepted by others because Feynman was a genius. In this case, one cannot take his behaviour as an example on how to live one's own life.
